Jeffail/util
============

This is a collection of some basic utilities for slapping golang services together. It currently has a logger, stats aggregation and configuration bootstrap, which all have better alternatives as individual projects around the internet.

The only purpose of this library is to keep the behaviour of my various services consistent. My plan is to slowly move these logging, stats and config options to better third party alternatives, but wrap them within this library for easy switching.
